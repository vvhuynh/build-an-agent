# AI Grocery Shopping Agent

Welcome to the **AI Grocery Shopping Agent** - an intelligent web application that optimizes your grocery shopping experience using NVIDIA's Llama 3.3 70B model and advanced AI agents! üõíü§ñ

## üöÄ Project Overview

This application demonstrates how **AI agents** can solve real-world problems by combining:
- **Large Language Models** (NVIDIA Llama 3.3 70B)
- **Multi-agent architecture** for complex decision making
- **Web interface** with modern UI/UX
- **Intelligent optimization algorithms** for shopping efficiency

## üéØ What It Does

The AI Grocery Shopping Agent helps you:
- **Generate optimized shopping lists** for any recipe
- **Find the best prices** across multiple grocery stores
- **Stay within budget** with intelligent cost optimization
- **Minimize store visits** while maximizing savings
- **Get cooking advice** through conversational AI
- **Browse recipes** across multiple cuisines

## üè™ Supported Stores

- **Walmart** - Budget-friendly, 25-35% cheaper
- **Target** - Convenience, market prices
- **Whole Foods** - Premium/organic, 40-80% premium
- **Kroger** - Traditional grocery, market prices
- **Trader Joe's** - Quality focus, 5-15% premium
- **Aldi** - Budget-friendly, 25-35% cheaper

## üçΩÔ∏è Recipe Categories

- **Italian** - Pizza, pasta, carbonara, alfredo, parmesan
- **Mexican** - Tacos, guacamole, fajitas
- **Asian** - Curry, stir fry, sushi
- **American** - BBQ, breakfast, sandwiches
- **Seafood** - Fish tacos, shrimp scampi, salmon
- **Vegetarian** - Salads, lasagna, stir fry

## ü§ñ AI Agent Architecture

### Multi-Agent System
1. **Main Orchestrator Agent** - Coordinates all other agents
2. **Recipe Analysis Agent** - Converts food items to ingredient lists
3. **Pricing Intelligence Agent** - Simulates realistic store pricing
4. **Optimization Agent** - Balances cost, convenience, and budget
5. **Budget Validation Agent** - Ensures constraints are met
6. **Conversational Agent** - Provides cooking and shopping advice

### Complex Decision Making
The agents work together to solve optimization problems:
- **Multi-objective optimization** (cost, convenience, quality)
- **Contextual decision making** (seasonal pricing, store specialties)
- **Adaptive reasoning** (handles unknown recipes intelligently)
- **Budget-aware planning** (70-95% optimal utilization)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI Model**: NVIDIA Llama 3.3 70B Instruct
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **AI Framework**: OpenAI API with NVIDIA endpoints
- **Optimization**: Custom algorithms for shopping optimization
