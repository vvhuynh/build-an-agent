# Build An Agent Hackathon

Welcome to the **Build An Agent Hackathon**! This hands-on workshop teaches you how to create intelligent AI agents that can perform complex tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools. You'll build a **Document Generation Agent** - an intelligent system that can research any topic, create comprehensive outlines, write detailed sections, and compile professional reports automatically. Unlike simple workflows, agents are intelligent programs that can adapt to changing requirements, choose tools dynamically, and perform complex reasoning and planning.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this hackathon, you'll know how to create an agent that can:
- **Use tools** to perform actions like web searches, API calls, and data processing
- **Maintain conversation context** across multiple interactions
- **Make decisions** about next steps based on available information
- **Handle complex multi-step workflows** autonomously
