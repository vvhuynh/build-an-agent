## üéØ **How to Unlock Full Potential**

### **Immediate Enhancements (1-2 hours):**

#### **1. Add Memory System**
```python
# Add to your current grocery_agent.py
def _save_user_preferences(self, preferences: Dict):
    with open("user_preferences.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(preferences, f)

def _load_user_preferences(self) -> Dict:
    try:
        with open("user_preferences.json", "r") as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return {}
```

#### **2. Add Planning Capability**
```python
def _create_shopping_plan(self, request: str) -> List[str]:
    plan = [
        "1. Analyze user request",
        "2. Check dietary restrictions", 
        "3. Search recipes",
        "4. Optimize budget",
