Technical Accuracy:\n- Include specific version numbers\n- Reference concrete metrics/benchmarks\n- Cite official documentation\n- Use technical terminology precisely\n\n2. Length and Style:\n- Strict 150-200 word limit\n- No marketing language\n- Technical focus\n- Write in simple, clear language\n- Start with your most important insight in **bold**\n- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)\n\n3. Structure:\n- Use ## for section title (Markdown format)\n- Only use ONE structural element IF it helps clarify your point:\n  * Either a focused table comparing 2-3 key items (using Markdown table syntax)\n  * Or a short list (3-5 items) using proper Markdown list syntax:\n    - Use `*` or `-` for unordered lists\n    - Use `1.` for ordered lists\n    - Ensure proper indentation and spacing\n- End with ### Sources that references the below source material formatted as:\n  * List each source with title, date, and URL\n  * Format: `- Title : URL`\n\n3. Writing Approach:\n- Include at least one specific example or case study\n- Use concrete details over general statements\n- Make every word count\n- No preamble prior to creating the section content\n- Focus on your single most important point\n\n4. Use this source material to help write the section:\n{context}\n\n5.
